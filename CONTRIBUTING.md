3. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

## Fork & Clone the Repository

1. **Fork** the official repo to your own GitHub account by clicking the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button at the top-right:  
   `https://github.com/HuckleberryLovesYou/Docs` ‚Üí `https://github.com/<your-username>/Docs`
   
2. **Clone** your fork locally:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Docs.git
   cd Docs
```

3. Add the upstream remote (the original repo) so you can stay in sync:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/HuckleberryLovesYou/Docs.git
git fetch upstream
```


4. Configure Git
   Set your name and email so your commits are attributed properly:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
5. Check your settings:
```bash
git config --list
```
## Working on a Branch
Always create a new branch for each logical change:
```bash
# Update your local main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b fix-typo-module1
```

Branch naming suggestions:
- fix/... for typos or small fixes
- feature/... for new content or modules
- docs/... for substantial documentation changes

## Making Changes
Edit or add Markdown (.md) files in the appropriate folder.

Preview your changes locally in your editor or in Obsidian.

#### Stage your changes:
```bash
git add path/to/your-file.md
```

#### Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m <commit_message>
```

#### Commit Messages
Clear commit messages make review easier. Use this template:
```

<type> (<scope>): <short summary>

[optional longer description]
```

type:
feat, fix, add, style, refactor

scope: 
directory or file name, e.g. _IPv4 or Home

short summary:
less than 50 characters

## Opening a Pull Request
#### Push your branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin fix-typo-module1
```
Go to your fork on GitHub. You‚Äôll see a ‚ÄúCompare & pull request‚Äù button‚Äîclick it.

#### Fill out the PR template:
Title: same as your commit summary or following the [[CONTRIBUTING#Commit Messages|Commit Messages Template]].

Description: What did you change? Why? Screenshots or examples are welcome.

Submit the PR against HuckleberryLovesYou/Docs:main.

## Review Process
The repo maintainer (Tim Matheis) will review your changes, request modifications if needed, and merge once everything looks good.

You may be asked to rebase or update your branch if main has moved ahead.

## Getting Help
If you run into any issues:
Ask questions in an issue on GitHub and Ping @timmatheis in the issue or PR thread.

We‚Äôre happy to help you get started!
